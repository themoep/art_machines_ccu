# art_machines_ccu
tool to create frames

based on Double Pendulum by Daniel Shiffman and inspired by film #3 by Joost Rekveld
created during the art_machines .2 workshop at creative coding utrecht 2019-05-18

this is the state it was presented in during the workshop

uses processing 3 and the controlP5 library

to create a gif I used the command `convert -delay 4 -loop 0 *tif first.gif` from the imagemagick package available on ubuntu.
